## Patterns

This document have all patterns for my projects. I decided put it in a repository to a form of documentation, also, this may be used for another people and it was open for PR or Issues to improve the quality of the process.

### Repository names

All repositories names should use *kebab case* like **game-store** or **movie-guide**.
Important: all letters should be lower case.

## Repository comment

All **branches, pull requests and comments** should use a descriptive emoji to ilustrate your funcionality.

The list bellow are using [this repository](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)

| emoji         | code            | funcionality  |
| :-----------: |:--------------- | :-------------|
| :tada:        | `:tada:`        | Initial commit|
| :sparkles:    | `:sparkles:`    | New feature   |
| :wrench:      | `:wrench:`      | Fix           |
| :recycle:     | `:recycle:`     | Refactoring   |
| :package:     | `:package:`     | Package.json  |
| :construction:| `:construction:`| In work       |
| :white_check_mark:| `:white_check_mark:`| tests  |
| :green_heart: | `:green_heart:` | CI            |
| :pencil:      | `:pencil:`      | Documentation |
| :poop:        | `:poop:`        | Deprecation   |


## Readme.md

All readme.md should use [this](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/README.sample.md) example. Sometimes all items are not necessary, in this case use only the necessary.
